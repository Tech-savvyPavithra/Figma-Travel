Travel App UI Design:
Welcome to the Travel App UI Design project! This repository showcases my beginner-level journey into UI/UX design, where I created a visually appealing and user-friendly travel app interface using Figma. The goal was to inspire users to explore their dream destinations while experimenting with color theory, layout design, and intuitive user flows.

Concept:
The app is designed to:

1. Evoke wanderlust and serenity through thoughtful visuals.
2. Provide an intuitive and seamless user experience for travelers.
3. Color Palette
4. The color palette was chosen to invoke trust, adventure, and clarity:

Color Palette:
The color palette was chosen to invoke trust, adventure, and clarity:
1. Blue (#2084E2) and Dark Blue (#0F2A63) for trust and adventure.
2. Black (#000000) and Grey (#787878) for balance and clarity.
3. White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and minimalist look.
   
Typography:
Clean and modern fonts were selected to enhance readability and overall aesthetic.

Effects and Details:
1. Subtle shadows were used to add depth and polish.
2. Rounded corners provided a modern, approachable look.
3. Alignment and hierarchy were emphasized to guide users effortlessly through the interface.

Screens:
1. Main Screen: A vibrant introduction to the app, inviting users to explore.
2. Home Screen: Displays popular travel destinations with categories such as:
        1. Most Viewed
        2. Nearby

        1. Location
        2. Weather
        3. Duration

Features and Highlights:
1. Experimented with color theory to evoke emotions.
2. Focused on creating clean layouts for better user experience.
3. Designed user flows that are intuitive and user-centric.

Future Improvements
